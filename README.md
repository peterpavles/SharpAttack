# SharpAttack

SharpAttack is a console for certain things I use often during security assessments. It leverages .NET and the Windows API to perform its work. It contains commands for domain enumeration, code execution, and other fun things.

## Building

SharpAttack is distributed as source code. Binaries will not be made available. To build SharpAttack:

1. Clone the repo with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/jaredhaight/SharpAttack`
2. Build with a recent version of Microsoft's [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). The free, community edition will work fine. 
    * **BEFORE YOU BUILD** From the `\SharpAttack\SharpSploit` folder, run `msbuild /t:restore` to restore its packages. (Honestly I dont think it has packages, by Visual Studio disagrees)
    * Make sure that when you build the project, you're targeting the version of .NET thats appropriate for your needs. 
    * Your build should result in a copy of SharpAttack.exe and SharpSploit.dll
4. You can use Microsoft's [ILMerge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17630) to merge SharpSploit.dll with the SharpAttack executable into a single file (`.\ILMerge.exe SharpAttack.exe SharpSploit.dll /out:.\SharpAttackBundle.exe`). 
    * The only DLL that needs to be bundled with SharpAttack is SharpSploit. Any other DLLs can be ingnored. 
    * Make sure to delete any pdb files before doing this else you'll get errors.

## Using SharpAttack
SharpAttack can be used as a standalone console or from the command line. To use SharpAttack from the command line, simply run `sharpattack.exe` followed by the command you'd like to run. For example:

```
.\SharpAttack.exe PowerShell Get-Date
```

If your parameter has spaces in it, wrap it in quotes (example: `SharpAttack.exe powershell "get-date; echo woot"`).

Some parameters accepts lists (mainly the ComputerName and IPAddress params). These should be entered as comma seperated values with no spacing (example: `-ComputerName target1,target2,target3`)

The `help` command lists what commands are available and what they do. You can also run `help <command>` to get help with a specific command and see its parameters.

Where possible, SharpAttack tries to use positional parameters (For example, `powershell get-date` works as well as `powershell -command get-date`). 

SharpAttack also works with Cobalt Strikes `execute-assembly`, just as it would on the command line. This does require that the SharpSploit library be trimmed down a bit, which I do by removing `Mimikatz.cs` from the SharpSploit project before compiling.

## Thanks
SharpAttack is built on top of [Cobbr's](https://twitter.com/cobbr_io) incredible [SharpSploit Project](https://github.com/cobbr/SharpSploit). SharpAttack is basically an easy way to interact with SharpSploit.
